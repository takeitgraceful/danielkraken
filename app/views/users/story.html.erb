        Another totally normal paragraph, but this time,
        it’s accompanied by a side note, sometimes also called boxout.
        This works well with CSS grid with the exception of side notes
        that take up more height than their related paragraph.
        Gotta try to avoid that.
      </p>

      <p class="side-note">This is the mentioned side note. It’s very good.</p>

      <p>An ordinary, totally normal paragraph. No strings attached, no promises attached. Just dull content. Trust me.</p>
